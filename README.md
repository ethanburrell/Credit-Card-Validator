# Credit-Card-Validator
A little JS that I had to write for a client. Validates the Credit Card Number and determines the brand of the card.
<br>
Uses Luhn's Algorithm to validate the card number. Thank you to <a href="https://gist.github.com/DiegoSalazar/4075533">DiegoSalazar</a> with providing me a quick, working solution to the algorithm.
<br>
Uses Regex created by <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/creditcard.html">regular-expressions.info</a> to find the brand of the card.
